DSP Insurance Pricing Model
Project Documentation

Overview
A machine learning model to optimize insurance pricing for Amazon's Delivery Service Partners (DSPs). The model analyzes 15+ risk factors to predict optimal premium pricing and identify business opportunities.
Goal: Build a data-driven pricing system that maximizes profitability while remaining competitive in the market.

Most Important Risk Factors

Historical Claims (25%) - Past claims predict future risk
Safety Incidents (16%) - More accidents = higher premiums
Fleet Size (13%) - Larger fleets = more exposure
Urban Density (10%) - City driving = higher risk
Weather Risk (9%) - Bad weather = more claims
